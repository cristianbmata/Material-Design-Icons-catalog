A flutter application for extract list of your favorites icons.

I built this for a very particular use.

Features include: 
- List Material Design icons by page.
- Select and remove by tap. 
- Order list by drag
- Remove by swipe
- Export selected icons by share


## Selection page

Select/unselect by tab, browse by page.
For clear all selection tab on [clear] button.
